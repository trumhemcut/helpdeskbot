    "text": "Make sure of the following:\n\n- You have a fast  **4â€“200GB microSD ** (Lumia with Windows Phone 8:  **4-128GB microSD** ) memory card by a well-known manufacturer.\n- Your memory card is not full (there should be at least about 50 MB of free memory on the card).\n- Your memory card is not password protected. To check if your memory card is password protected, connect it to a PC with a USB reader that has a microSD card slot. If the card cannot be accessed, it is password protected. Remove the password from your memory card using the device where it was previously used.\n\nIf your memory card has thousands of media items, the file system scan may consume considerable amounts of your phone processing power even when running in the background. If you think that is the issue, go to  **Settings**  >  **System**  >  **Storage** , tap on the **SD card (D:)****  **and at the bottom of the screen tap ** Remove** (Lumia with Windows Phone 8: **App ** list, select ** Storage Sense **, tap the ** SD card **** ** bar and tap  **remove SD card** ). You can access your memory card next time you restart your phone.\n\nIf you see the Scan SD card and fix errors message box, tap  **Yes**  to have your phone scan the card and try to fix any errors. If you see an SD card scan failed message, insert the memory card into a PC and try and fix it there with these steps."
