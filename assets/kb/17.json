To see more commands, check out  [Cortana on HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12630), or just say &quot;Hey Cortana, what can I say?&quot;\n\n**Select**. Use this instead of air tap. Gaze at a hologram, then say &quot;Select.&quot;\n\n**Place**. Instead of air tapping to place a hologram, say &quot;Place.&quot;\n\n**Face me**. Gaze at a hologram, then say &quot;Face me&quot; to turn it your way.\n\n**Bigger/Smaller**. Gaze at a hologram, then say &quot;Bigger&quot; or &quot;Smaller&quot; to resize it.\n\n**Hey Cortana, go to Start**. Use this instead of  [bloom](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12644) to get to Start.\n\n**Hey Cortana, shut down**. Turn off your HoloLens.\n\n**Hey Cortana, move &lt;app name> here**. Gaze at the spot you want the app to move to.\n\n**Hey Cortana, take a picture**. Snap a quick photo.\n\nMany buttons and other elements on HoloLens also respond to your voice—for example,  **Adjust**  and  **Remove**  on the app bar. To find out if a button is voice enabled, rest your gaze on it for a moment. If it is, you'll see a voice tip."
