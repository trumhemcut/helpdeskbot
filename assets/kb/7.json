Find them by selecting the Start button, or type mail or calendar in the search box on the taskbar.\n\nYou've found the apps, now make them useful by adding your accounts. If this is the first time you're opening either Mail or Calendar, follow the instructions on the Welcome page. Otherwise, do the following:\n\n1. In the Mail or Calendar app, select **Settings** at the lower left.\n2. Select  **Manage Accounts**  >  **Add account** , choose an account, and then follow the instructions.\n\nYour mail and calendar start syncing as soon as your account is set up. To add more accounts, return to Settings.\n\nA few more handy things:\n\n- No need to add the same account twiceâ€”when you add it to one app, the other app automatically connects to the same account.\n- Switch between Mail and Calendar by selecting **Switch to Mail** or **Switch to Calendar** on the lower-left side of the window. To see the contacts associated with your accounts, select **Switch to People** to open the People app."
