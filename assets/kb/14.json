    "text": "Tablet mode makes Windows easier and more intuitive to use with touch on devices like 2-in-1s, or when you don't want to use a keyboard and mouse. To turn on tablet mode, select **action center**  on the taskbar and then select **Tablet mode**.\n\nStart and apps (including older programs) open full screen, giving you more space to work in. To use two apps side by side, drag an app to one side. You'll see where it'll snap, along with any open apps that can snap right next to it.\n\nIn tablet mode, there are a few more things you can do:\n\n- Use the shared edge between two snapped apps to resize both at the same time.\n- Select **Task view** on the taskbar and then drag an app to a side to snap it directly from task view.\n- Use the back  button on the taskbar to go back in an app or to the previous app you were using.\n- Drag an app to the bottom of the screen to close it.\n\nFor more about using touch, see  [Use touch with Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17209)."
